    <h1>MyFlix API</h1>
    <p>
      The MyFlix API is the server-side component of a movie web application. It
      provides users with access to information about movies, directors, and
      genres. The API allows users to sign up, update their personal
      information, and create a list of their favorite movies. Developers can
      use this API to build interactive web applications focused on movie
      exploration and user preference management.
